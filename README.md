- 👋 Hi, I’m @davendramaharaj1
- 👀 I’m a 4th year Computer Engineering Student at the University of Toronto and I am very interested in Computer Architecture and building large-scale software systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Vulkan due to my internship as a 3D Software Engineer at AMD and I am interested in doing research at the intersection of deep learning and systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to large-scale software, deep learning or building architectures aimed at machine learning or the data centre.
