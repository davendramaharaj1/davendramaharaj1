- 👋 Hi, I’m @davendramaharaj1
- 👀 I’m a final year Computer Engineering Student at the University of Toronto and I am very interested in Computer Architecture and large-scale software systems.
- 👀 My academic/research interests are in:
  - Energy-efficient Deep Learning Accelerators using FPGAs and other AI processors
  - Programming models to scale hard-to-parallelize applications for multicore/parallel architectures
  - High-performance computing
- 🌱 I was also a SWE intern @ AMD where I contrbuted to their Vulkan & OpenGL drivers as well as improve their performance on gaming applications. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to large-scale software, deep learning or building architectures aimed at machine learning or the data centre.
